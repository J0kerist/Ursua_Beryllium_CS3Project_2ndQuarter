			<p>
The Covid-19 pandemic is a global health crisis that has affected many lives and industries. In spite of this, many countries have already been rid of the virus, and our country is among the unfortunate ones who are still dealing with the crisis. Our country has been under lockdown for 8 long months and yet, we still cannot put an end to this pandemic in our country, let alone flatten the curve.
</p>

<p>
Most south-east Asian countries like Malaysia, Thailand, and Vietnam have already gone back to their normal lives. The secret to this is effective and efficient leadership. No prolonged lockdowns, no stalling for vaccines, just good and efficient governance. The Covid-19 situation for these countries were handled by professionals in the field of science and medicine. Contact-tracing protocols and disciplined citizens also aided in the fast recovery of these countries from the pandemic that is Covid-19.
</p>

<p>
Us Filipinos can only wish that we lived in one of those countries. We’ve been placed under lockdown for more than 8 months, yet there still isn’t any proper response or plan of action coming from the government. Medical front-liners are getting infected and dying left and right, but the government does not seem to realize this. When the Filipino people asked for plans when it comes to handling the situation, what we got was white sand and more circus shenanigans. 
</p>
<p>
What the country needs is efficient leadership if its leaders have any interest in listening to the pleas of the masses. Government leaders must put aside their personal interests and allow real medical professionals to handle the pandemic. That is the only way our country will be free from this pandemic that has claimed many lives and caused many to suffer.
