				We can recall that reports of 15 billion pesos worth of health insurance funds being lost due to corruption has been widespread throughout the nation only recently. In an interview on the 2nd of February, 2021, Philippine Health Insurance Corporation (PhilHealth) president Dante Gierran stated that 94% of the 15 billion-peso funds allegedly lost to corruption has already been liquidated. In spite of this statement, many citizens are still in disbelief as the credibility of a statement like this coming from an organization with alleged involvement in corruption is still rather questionable. 
			</p>
			<p>
				News of wealth amounting to 15 billion pesos being hoarded by corrupt government officials especially during a major health crisis is a serious blow to our nation. An amount this large would have been very helpful in our fight against COVID-19 which has already impaired the nationâ€™s economy. An incident such as this one is also a blow to the credibility of government bodies. The government must see to it that public trust is not broken in a time of crisis such as the one we face right now; wherein efficient leadership is important.
			</p>
			<p>
				If what the president of the organization in question is true, then it is expected of him to release a breakdown of how the expenses were liquidated and how an amount that large was lost to begin with. This should give their words some credibility and hopefully rebuild the declining trust and approval of the masses to our government.
