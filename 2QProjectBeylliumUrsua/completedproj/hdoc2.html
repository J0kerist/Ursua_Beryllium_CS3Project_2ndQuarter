				On the 20th of December, 2020, a video of an off-duty cop brutally murdering an old lady and her son took the internet by strom. Some were sad, others were silent, and many were angry. This incident shows very clearly how those in authority abuse their powers to opress the common Filipino. 
			</p>

			<p>
				Prior to this incident, there have already been many cases of police brutality in our country. This is no surprise to us Filipinos considering the violent 'Drug War' that ensued over the last four years is a flagship project of the current administration. The excuse most commonly used by authorities to cover up violence and brutality such as this one is that the victims allegedly took up arms and resisted arrest. As much as I'd hate to admit, in the absence of credible proof that is the viral video, the case of the Gregorio family would have been no different.
			</p>

			<p>
				This tragedy shows us how much our government needs reform. Under an incompetent and violence-enabling administration, our nation is doomed to ruin. Authority as a basic principle, must always go hand-in-and with morality. If authorities continue to lead with disregard to human rights and moral principles, they're actions lose credibility before the masses.
